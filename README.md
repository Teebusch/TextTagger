# CLI text Tagger

This is a little applicaiton for the R console that goes through a data frame row by row (e.g., input from a spreadsheet) and allows to add tags to it.

Currently tags are presented one after the other and the user selects yes, no maybe.

I used this for screening abstracts for a literature review.

Made for educational purposes, because he R `cli` package looked like fun and I wanted to give it a try. 

There are better ways to review abstracts, but maybe there are some applications for something like this?

Lots of bugs. Use at your own risk.
